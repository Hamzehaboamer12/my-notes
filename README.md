***My name is Hamza Ibrahim, I graduated from the Hashemite University in 2020 with a major in computer science, I joined the software development course at Luminus College to develop my job skills and get a job after completing the course***.

### Summary of the article ###

***There are many small factors that slowly and gradually harm a developer’s projects , To avoid this you should embrace the fundamental laws of software. You should develop a mindset that every developer should have and You can keep your software as simple as possible and all of this can be achieved by developing a number of points for each developer such as*** .

- Know The Purpose of Software :  **The first thing at all  the developer should understand the purpose of the software there is To help people** .

- The Goals of Software Design :  **the design should be easy to you and helpful for others**.

- Simplicity :  **the good developer is doing everything in their power to make the code as simple as possible for other programmers**.

- Maintenance : **should all developers should care about code maintenance , Simplicity and complexity are the two main factors that affect code maintenance. The ease of maintenance of any piece of software is proportional to the simplicity of its individual piece**.

- Consistency : **Consistency is a big part of simplicity and Code that isn’t consistent becomes harder to understand**.

- Solving Problems : **The first step is understanding Most hard problems are hard because you don’t understand them and the second step is planning to take action and The third step is dividing ( don’t try to slove bid problem but Divide it into smaller tasks and solve each sub-problem one by one)**.

- Prediction :  **A prediction is simply a forecast that something will happen in the future (Don’t predict to future. Be only as generic as you know you need to be right now)** .


- Resistance : **As a developer, your first reaction to changing requests should be "NO"   Because unnecessary changes will increase defects in your software** . 

- Automation : **Don’t spend your time on repetitive tasks , If you can automate it, automate it**.

- Productivity : **Your main goal should be keeping your code base as small as possible**. 

- Testing : **You should add logging in a very early stage. This will help you to find the problem easily and save your time , When you have a bug, first you should reproduce it. You shouldn’t guess the source of the bug and apply fixes based on your assumption. Most probably, you will be wrong. You should see it with your own eyes before applying the fix** .

- Running Away From Rewriting :  **There are many cases that you should consider to rewrite your code from scratch  , very important simple advice for you : Refactoring should be the first option**.


- Documentation and Commenting : **The real purpose of comments is to explain “WHY” you did something, not “WHAT” the code is doing , always write a comment to explain “WHY”, not to explain “WHAT" And documenting  is very  important to have documentation to explain your software’s architecture** . 

- Picking Technologies (Tools, Libraries) :   **the First important  things Don’t depend on external technologies. But when you have to do so, try to reduce your dependency on them as much as you can Because they are another common source of. complexity**.

- Self-Development : **Keep learning. Try out different programming languages and tools, read books on software development**. 

- Don’t Ask Questions… Ask For Help : **When you have something to implement and you are not sure about the solutions, don’t ask others how to so it …at least not immediately. Instead, try anything and everything you can think of**.
